This is the directions for the grade submiter from blackboard to canvas (GSBC):
	1.After downloading the folder, click inside the folder and right click GSBC.exe ONCE
	2.Then, click "Create Shortcut". Drag the file it makes, "GSBC.exe - Shortcut", to your desktop to open 
	the program easily from your desktop.
		-You might have to give access to various other things for the program to work.
	3.Double click on the shortcut you just created to open the program.
	4.Enter the information the program asks for. The passwords will be hidden as you type them, so don't worry
	about your password not showing as you type.
		- If you mess-up while typing the password, just hold backspace to clear the entry.
		- If your password and/or username is wrong, it will ask for it again later.
		- Your data will not be saved, so please remember your information.
	5.A chrome window will open during the process. You can minimize it, but please do not interact with it. It 
	could potentially mess-up the program.
	6.If your information is correct and there are no errors, then you can just minimize the tab, check to see if
	it finished submitting later, then close the window if it says finished.
If there is any problem in your connection (e.g. Blackboard is a blocked website) and the program complains about it, then close the window and try again later when problem is fixed. If there's any other type of error that the program complains about, please contact Mrs. Davda or Mrs. Varner so they can report the problem. If you have already submitted to canvas's latest grade report, then it won't submit again. It will give you an error.

Hope you enjoy the program!!!
